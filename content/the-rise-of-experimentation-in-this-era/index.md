It was late in the evening and Stacy was still hovering over the ‘Send’ button on her email titled **_‘FitForYou Campaign Report: Bright Colors in store aisles’._** Her uncertainty was not unfounded. She knew her research was impressive and it worked well in the few stores chosen. But was she ready to take up the onus of the 2 million dollar deal, to rollout this change in all FitForYou stores? What if she was missing something? 

The rise of machine learning [initiated in the 1950](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_machine_learning), but reached its full swing post-2010, when researchers in the last two decades had sorted out things like kernels, SVMs, and RNNs from (1990–2010). Today as we join the rally of corporates chanting ‘AI now!’, it is only slowly dawning upon us the ways our own lives will change right before our eyes. 

Industrial Revolution focused on [replacing manual power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uawLjkSI7Mo&feature=youtu.be), followed by the Digital Revolution, which changed everything right from wrist-watches to airplanes, today we are in a revolution that focuses on replacing mental/cognitive abilities that are monotonous by incorporating complex software or intelligence (models) in every solution be it predicting Doctor’s consultation fee or choosing the right players in National teams. With overwhelming amounts of data generated, tracked and stored, we use **statistics and machine learning models**, to help humans, customers and businesses across the globe make better decisions, at a much faster pace.

It goes beyond removing drudgery from our day to day lives and aids us in achieving what we didn’t know we could achieve or even should be achieving.

Let’s go back to Stacy. How could we solve her dilemma? 

As a Growth Manager of her company, FitForYou — a fashion store that recommended styles fit for women, she had come up with a store-remodeling experiment to paint some stores of FitForYou in NYC with brighter shades. This was based on her research on Human psychology and Behavior during her Masters in Columbia University. It was a 2 month long experiment. However she wasn’t sure if her request for funding to rollout her ‘Bright colors- campaign’ in all the stores of NYC would go in vain.

We, at Trial Run, specialize in helping companies like ‘FitForYou’ to carry out such _experiments_ and especially if those are aimed at large scale. All Stacy needs to do is test her campaign in a small number of stores (for which she did get a green signal) and let our intelligent system do all the math and crunching of possibilities, providing her with enough evidence whether the campaign would succeed or not. (It would even predict the exact stores where Stacy should run the campaign!) 

Here we’re focusing on eliminating the lack of confidence people have while running experiments in every industry. In Retail, almost 90% of commerce happens in physical stores and every retailer or manager has several tricks up her sleeve to make their customers buy [more](https://www.businessinsider.in/19-tricks-stores-use-to-make-you-spend-more-money/19-tricks-stores-use-to-make-you-spend-more-money/slideshow/49521312.cms). 

Automating the herculean task of tracking all of those experiments, (tricks or teeny-weeny changes), cloning and iterating the same and visualizing the results across cohorts, Trial Run assures results which would help companies fund the right campaigns at the right time!

Let’s take Warren Buffet, say, he binged watched all the Food documentaries on Netflix, last weekend. All of them showed how kids in cities today and even in his neighborhood were leading an excessively sedentary lifestyle and turning obese, facing serious health risks at an early age.

Troubled by it, if he decides to put his money to create a long term solution for this (afterall he is worth 8,210 crores USD) by providing organic foods to all the working couples with kids in the NY City. For doing this, he would have to find all those shops delivering organic foods to these homes that can afford to buy organic foods on a regular basis. 

  

  

  

  

  

  

If retail-giants like [Walmart](https://medium.com/walmartlabs) or small budding ones like \_\_\_\_\_\_, were to go about testing a new way of billing their walk-in customers or simply analyze the effect of keeping products of competing companies in the same aisles, they can go ahead rolling out these changes to all of their stores across regions with more certainty than ever.  

This doesn’t end with retail stores or just physical stores today. It has become the need of the hour to experiment in every industry. Are you Stacy in a bank? Or a pharmaceutical company ? Any and every business in the world today has to find new ways to sustain, thrive and make it big. However, this has to be done with minimum loss and maximum gain. Remember the math classes you attended in high school, trying to solve the Traveling Salesman problem. Our objectives in live haven’t changed much today. What’s changed is the way we approach change or execute changes. 

> “Today, people buy experiences, not products,” Shantanu Narayen, Adobe’s CEO 

Experience is everything, and with changing times, all industries from the shop next door to the one you see raising a hoarding at the end of the road, we realize the increasing importance of creating seamless experiences for consumers. We see even those building these experiences as customers :)

Our goal is to create experiences that are as seamless as possible allowing designing, and analyzing of experiments in one go. (We have got your back) Visualizing the effects of your campaign, Trial run helps you understand the lasting impact in each of your regions, branches. etc.
