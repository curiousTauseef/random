Its about time, I believe, I tell you a story. My story, after an year of work.

Scanning in my index finger to buzz in to a place that has become my second home after a crazy traffic hour on road, I pause to ponder the changes in life, from an year ago,… when I used to casually walk into the cosy cocoon of my Engineering college classroom (just when a teacher left the room) greeted by the ‘Wassup?’ shout-outs and hi-fives as soon as you sit down at the last bench with friends in contrast to the silent scrutinizing looks, even from strangers that clock your every move inside the workplace. Instead of notepads and borrowed pens, you pull out a Macbook from your bag and place it at the desk assigned to you, you sit down in front of the big HD screen, with a steaming chai and headphones, to start your day.

Work to every twenty something is 'responsibility' with a capital R. It’s not just showing up that is a great task, but fulfilling expectations and not falling out of the bad books.

My mind was introduced to computer science as something that could make machines, fun games, robots, and everything magical at the age of 16 at Carnegie Mellon, Qatar. Every semester at College and every day at my first job, I didn’t do any of this, but slowly, ever so slowly I learnt the various fields we could apply computer science to. Be it fashion, shopping malls, radiologists, environment, sales, manufacturing industry etc.

I had never been a fan of HTML and CSS, but writing functions to do my biding has always fascinated me, almost as if I had a [djinni](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/334123.The_Amulet_of_Samarkand) at my disposal. JavaScript gave me just that. I could make lists, trees, objects, and even classes now(Thanks to ES6). 

The corporate world I stepped into has been kind. Maybe I expected it to be lot a worse(thanks to all the articles and memes on ‘Monday -blues’, ‘harassment-at-work’ etc.) My team had all kinds of people, from ‘not-really-amateurs’ to ‘very-well-experienced/subject-matter experts’ and I came in as an eager novice with a just teeny weeny 2 month corporate experience as a developer intern. I am sure my mentor from there would be proud of the code I write today, at least with names I chose today for my files and functions :P 

Being a part of a live project, one that is deployed every quarter to production server and everyday to the testing server(if not every hour), I have learnt a lot.
