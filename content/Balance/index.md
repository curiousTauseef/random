 There should be balance between things you should be doing and things you love doing. This is regardless of who you are, what age you are, whether you are married, or if you are a mother of 2 kids. 

 Each and every person has his own hobbies, favourite passtimes and desires. She/he also has the share of responsibilities of work, household chores etc. which might not always be what one wanted to do in the first place. Else everyone would be an AI scientist who writes novels on Sundays and plays Cricket every Friday for his Country!
