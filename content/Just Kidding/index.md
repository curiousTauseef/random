 Have you ever heard your colleagues say things they really want to say, but add a "just kidding (wink) smile" to it. They are NOT kidding. Pay attention. 
 Why? 
 Since, most of the time, people say everything on their minds. Be it managers, principals, acting managers, acting principals, they say what is exactly it is that they are thinking and later on just add 'just kidding' to avoid appearing as an amateur or an open-book.

 (FYI: acting = substitutes for a short period of time, in the absence of the actual head/lead)
