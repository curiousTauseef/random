There used to be a time when you had to be told how everyone has their own set of troubles and how the assumption of you being the only one struggling was wrong.

But come this era, we have a new assumption, that everyone is so busy with their own set of problems, no one has the time to talk like old times. We assume everyone goes through the same problems at each phase of life.
