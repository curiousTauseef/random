So just before jumping into bed, after a long day(every day is the same length of 24 hours though :thinking-smiley:), just after I had moped the floors clean, wiped the sink clean until I could see my own reflection in it, kept leftovers in the fridge, ordered groceries for tomorrow, I saw a light at a balcony facing my bedroom window. The guy was staring at his phone in the middle of the night but out at his balcony.
