It was late in the evening and Stacy was still hovering over the ‘Send’ button on her email titled **_‘FitForYou Campaign: Bright Colors in store aisles’._** Her uncertainty was not unfounded. She knew her research was impressive, but was she ready to take up the onus of the 2 million dollar deal, to run this campaign in all FitForYou stores? Was she missing something?

Wait. Before we jump to resolving her dilemma, lets try to reach the same page first.

How many of you have baked a cake? 

What are the factors involved to ensure a successful cake? Factors might include preheating the oven, baking time, ingredients, amount of moisture, baking temperature, etc. — what else?

You probably follow a recipe so there are many additional factors that control the ingredients — i.e., a mixture. 

In other words, someone did the experiment in advance! 

Let’s try to relate this to what Stacy was doing. Her research said Bright colours in store aisles made people stay in the shops more and buy more. How could she confirm this? By running an experiment! 

But would you before making a cake, take an order for baking a 100 cakes for a café next door? No! Never. 

Even though you have the recipe, you would first try to make one or two or 10 cakes until you are confident to start taking in orders for large scale. 

Just like that, Stacy here, couldn’t just go about asking for funds to colour all 2000 stores of FitForYou, bright Orange Green and Yellow! 

Somehow the problem doesn’t just end there. 

When I was writing GRE a couple of years back, one of their favourite AWA questions were as a manager of a company — would you run the same campaign in two different cities or not? 

  

  

What parts of the recipe did they vary to make the recipe a success? Probably many factors, temperature and moisture, various ratios of ingredients, and presence or absence of many additives. 

Now, should one keep all the factors involved in the experiment at a constant level and just vary one to see what would happen? This is a strategy that works but is not very efficient.
