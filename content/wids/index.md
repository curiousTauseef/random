A conference comprising of solely Women Speakers from the field of computer science and data science in particular. 

Why data science? More and More decisions today data-driven. If women want to have a say in decision making, you need to know how to do data analytics, understand patterns, ask the right questions and make an impact. More diverse the teams are, better the decisions we make as a company. There are so many girls, so many women who want to be successful data scientists, but somehow lack the drive to be one, simply because they don’t find women in the field.
