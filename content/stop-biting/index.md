“When people reach out a hand, you don’t bite it … the only thing it does is that they stop reaching out.”

There are so many people around you who take care of you and love you. Your family, your friends or your neighbours, your colleagues, your dance class partners, your early morning football team players, your folks at church and so on. The list is quite long, if only, you pause, and rewind the day in your head. Think about all those folks who smiled at you, or addressed you by your name, maybe just for a casual “Hi”!

It is easy to go off the cliff and behave like you have no reason to smile or be happy. It is easy to take the “martyr route” or just “be grumpy”. Yeah. I have often tried to blame the circumstances in life and the restrictions I grew up with.

But, trust me, there is nothing in this world stopping you from just “being nice”, especially when the people around you are taking so much effort to be nice to you. Don’t bark every time you open your mouth, regardless of how you see it or how stressed you are. _It takes conscious effort not to_. Almost as much as it would take you to say “No” to carbs or sugar. Maybe more!

It takes two to quarrel and two to love.

Either you can complain about not having the “right people” in your life or the “right opportunities” or power to do somethings,

_or_

you can accept the people, the time, the chances you get and face whatever life offers you, “a helping hand” or “a challenge”, and **_reciprocate in kind_**!

Meet love with love. Kindness with kindness. Friendship with warmth.

Fear with Grit. Challenge with courage. Opportunity with willingness.

Feel the high of doing the _right things_ at the _right time_ and saying the right set of _words_ at the _right time._
