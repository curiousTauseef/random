 3 years ago on this day, I landed in this City, Mumbai. As soon as I did, I received a call from my interviewer, who would become my manager and little did I know, a very good friend. Before I write down praises about how awesome a manager he was(yes, 'was'), I think life seems to be having a good laugh at me, because today he is packing his bags to leave the same project, he hired me to work for. I know I'm going to miss how he stood up for us, how he mocked us and tricked us into learning, how different and kind he was compared to all of my friends' managers, but all I can think about is "How could he leave us behind in a ship, where he is not stationed at the quarterdeck"? 

 But I guess, Life goes on. 

 Besides like my colleague was quick to point out, this is a vicious cycle.
